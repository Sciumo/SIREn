SIREn 0.2.2 Solr Demo - Install Instructions

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is testing version of Solr 3.4 with SIREn.

We provide a solr configuration example which use SIREn for indexing and 
searching RDF data. The search interface is using the n-triples query language.

Basic steps:
  0) Install Tomcat 6
  1) Stop tomcat
  2) Clean previously installed siren
  3) Configure Solr/Siren webapp
  4) Copying context file
  5) Copying SIREn libs
  6) Change file permissions
  7) Start tomcat
  8) Load some data
  9) Run some queries

0. Install Tomcat 6
(NB: on Ubuntu, sudo apt-get install tomcat6)

1. STOP TOMCAT

- stop your tomcat instance before performing the following steps. 

> /etc/init.d/tomcat6 stop

2. CLEAN PREVIOUSLY INSTALLED SIREN

In order to avoid unexpected conflict with previously deployed Solr webapp,  
remove siren webapp directory
> rm -rf $CATALINA_BASE/webapps/siren

3. CONFIGURE SOLR/SIREN WEBAPP

Edit siren.xml to set the path of the war file and SORL_HOME correctly using 
/your/local/path/siren-solr/example/solr as SOLR_HOME:

4. COPYING CONTEXT FILE

Copy siren.xml to:
$CATALINA_BASE/conf/Catalina/localhost/siren.xml
(NB: you may need to create that folder)

5. COPYING SIREN LIBS

Build SIREn and copy siren-core-0.2.2.jar, 
siren-qparser-0.2.2.jar and siren-solr-0.2.2.jar in 
SOLR_HOME/lib.

6. CHANGE FILE PERMISSIONS

- ensure that tomcat has full file permissions on SOLR_HOME:

> chown -R tomcat6:tomcat6 $SOLR_HOME

7. START TOMCAT

- start tomcat

> /etc/init.d/tomcat6 start

- you should be able to access the Solr admin page at 
  http://localhost:8080/siren/
  
- if problems see $CATALINA_BASE/logs/catalina.out

8. LOAD DATA

We provide a script to load three artificial documents.
To load the three documents, just run the command 
"bash post.sh people.xml".

If you go to the statistic page [1] of the Solr admin interface, you should see
the counter 'numDocs' equals to 3.
 
[1] http://localhost:8080/siren/admin/stats.jsp 

9. EXECUTE QUERIES

Go to the query form of the Solr admin interface [2]. Replace 'standard' in the
field "Query Type" by 'siren' to activate the SIREn query parser.

You can now enter one of the following query in the "Solr/Lucene Statement" field:
Query 1: * <name> 'john AND gartner'
http://localhost:8080/siren/select?indent=on&nq=*+%3Cname%3E+%27john+AND+gartner%27&start=0&rows=10&fl=*%2Cscore&qt=siren&wt=standard
Query 2: * <workplace> <galway> AND * <type> <student> AND * <age> "26"
http://localhost:8080/siren/select?indent=on&nq=*+%3Cworkplace%3E+%3Cgalway%3E+AND+*+%3Ctype%3E+%3Cstudent%3E+AND+*+%3Cage%3E+%2226%22&start=0&rows=10&fl=*%2Cscore&qt=siren&wt=standard

You can also use the shell script 'query.sh' that will execute the two previous
queries using curl, and will display the result in XML format.
