{"name":"SIREn","tagline":"SIREn - Semantic Information Retrieval Engine","body":"# SIREn Open-Source Project\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\n\r\nEfficient, large scale handling of semi-structured data is increasingly an\r\nimportant issue to many web and enterprise information reuse scenarios.\r\n\r\nWhile Lucene has long offered these capabilities, its native capabilities are\r\nnot intended for collections of semi-structured documents (e.g., documents with\r\nvery different schemas, documents with arbitrary nested objects). For this\r\nreason we developed SIREn - Semantic Information Retrieval Engine - a\r\nLucene/Solr plugin to overcome these shortcomings and efficiently index and\r\nquery arbitrary JSON documents, as well as any JSON document with an\r\narbitrary amount of metadata fields.\r\n\r\nFor its features, SIREn can somehow be seen as halfway between Solr (of which\r\nit offers all the search features) and MongoDB (given it can index arbitrary\r\nJSON documents).\r\n\r\nSIREn is a Lucene/Solr extension for efficient semi-structured full-text search.\r\nSIREn is not a complete application by itself, but rather a code library and API\r\nthat can easily be used to create a full-featured semi-structured search engine.\r\n\r\n## Learn more about SIREn\r\n\r\nYou can watch a recent talk at Lucene Revolution 2013 about SIREn:\r\n\r\n* [High Performance JSON Search and Relational Faceted Browsing with Lucene](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KiZsx8GYtc)\r\n\r\n## Reference\r\n\r\nIf you are using SIREn for your scientific work, please cite the following article\r\nas follow:\r\n\r\n> Renaud Delbru, Stephane Campinas, Giovanni Tummarello, **Searching web data: An\r\n> entity retrieval and high-performance indexing model**, *In Web Semantics:\r\n> Science, Services and Agents on the World Wide Web*, ISSN 1570-8268,\r\n> [10.1016/j.websem.2011.04.004](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570826811000230).\r\n\r\n## Resources\r\n\r\nSIREn Github Project:\r\n\r\n    https://github.com/rdelbru/SIREn\r\n\r\nYou can download SIREn at:\r\n\r\n    https://github.com/rdelbru/SIREn\r\n\r\nPlease join the SIREn-User mailing list by subscribing at:\r\n\r\n    https://groups.google.com/d/forum/siren-user\r\n\r\n## Acknowledgements\r\n\r\nThe SIREn project is based upon works supported by:\r\n\r\n* the European FP7 Okkam (GA 215032) and LOD2 (257943) projects,\r\n* the SFI funded project Lion2 under Grant No. SFI/08/CE/I1380,\r\n* the Irish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology.\r\n\r\n- - -\r\n\r\nCopyright 2014, National University of Ireland, Galway\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
