# SIREn: Efficient semi-structured Information Retrieval for Lucene/Solr

## Introduction

Efficient, large scale handling of semi-structured data (including RDF) is
increasingly an important issue to many web and enterprise information reuse scenarios.

While Lucene has long offered these capabilities, its native capabilities are
not intended for large semi-structured document collections (or documents with
very different schemas). For this reason we developed SIREn - Semantic
Information Retrieval Engine - a Lucene/Solr plugin to overcome these shortcomings
and efficiently index and query RDF, as well as any textual document with an
arbitrary amount of metadata fields.

SIREn is a Lucene/Solr extension for effificent semi-structured full-text search.
SIREn is not a complete application by itself, but rather a code library and API
that can easily be used to create a full-featured semi-structured search engine.
